== Ranger v0.2.4

Ranger is a filemanager that integrates well into the linux shell and gives
you a quick way of doing operations that would otherwise require a lot of
typing, without starting up a bloated environment.

The program is written in Ruby and uses ncurses for the user interface.

== Getting Started

At first, it's a good idea to create a symlink in your bin dir:
    sudo ln -s /path/to/ranger /usr/bin/ranger

Now type in ranger to start it.

You should see 4 columns. The third is the directory where you are at
the moment. To the left, there are the the directories above the current
working dir, and the column on the right is a preview of the selected
file/directory.

Now use the arrow keys to navigate, press enter to open a file.

A list of commands with short descriptions can be viewed by
pressing ? inside the program and following the instructions.
The file code/keys.rb contains all keycombinations, so that's another
place you may want to check out.
More extensive documentation will be written when enough users ask me to :)


== Opening files with Ranger

If you use the same applications like me, you'll be able to open
files by pressing the right arrow key. If not, you will have to
specify them in the data/types.rb and data/apps.rb. It's explained
inside those files how exactly to do that.

Once you've set up your applications, you can also use ranger to
open files from the shell:
    ranger blabla.pdf


== Guidelines for the code:

Tabs for indentation, spaces for tables and such

Comment functions and classes with rdoc in mind

Usually, a "#" as the first character is "out-commented code"
whereas indented "#"s are actual comments

Use syntax compatible to both ruby1.8 and ruby1.9
at least until ruby1.9 works well enough
